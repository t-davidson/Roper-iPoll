# Roper-iPoll
Analysis of a survey question for Peter Enn's Fall 2017 class Public Opinion.

I analyzed Q47 from the April 2014 Reason-Rupe poll. The purpose of the exercise was to see if I could reproduce the descriptive results from the Roper Center website by reading in the ascii file and  using the weights provided with the raw survey data. Information about the question,
 my results, and associated metadata are included but the raw data is the
 property of the Roper Center and cannot be published here.
